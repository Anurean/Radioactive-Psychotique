So...
The cats in Olpe are abnormally large... even by our old standard.

Bubbah, aka Butterbrickle....
was a 14 pound cat. Which: was large.


The cats in Olpe these days are about 20-50 pounds in weight...
about the size of a small mountain cat or a smaller prarie/mountain lion.


So we have fat fluffy domestic cats...
The size of smaller "Large American Cat" such as a lynx or whatever.



Okay...
What do we do?
Can we breed them and sell them out to various persons?
