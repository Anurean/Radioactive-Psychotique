Subject: Olpe Cats (Large Abandoned Mutation/Unknown Breed from Colorado)

Who am I talking to at the Emporia Animal Shelter these days????

Is it Wendy Lewis?
If so... yeah I know you hate my ass. 
However hopefully we can quit being asstards to eachother.
Hopefully, you get the whole Gale situation.

Gale is only guilty by association with the little midget mob that bounced out of Kansas.
NOBODY from Kansas is to be spoken to while there is every last bit of crime going on that they have failed to report and/or are taking part in.






Before I venture back into my old demographic...
What's the situation?
What's the money?
I note an automobile that is not painted black in my childhood home.


I note... that Emporia is no longer Amityville.
I note... that Emporia is under English Imperialist Jurisdiction.
I note... that Olpe is much more so tribally angelic in population than my earliest childhood memories.
I note... that Olpe looks almost abandoned.


Let me guess... it's cuz I called the FBI on a few creepos with too many skeletons in their closet and strewn about the farm.






So...
The cats in Olpe are abnormally large... even by our old standard.

Bubbah, aka Butterbrickle....
was a 14 pound cat. Which: was large.


The cats in Olpe these days are about 20-50 pounds in weight...
about the size of a small mountain cat or a smaller prairie/mountain lion.
They are doubling in weight each decade, which leads me to the conclusion they are mutating due to the nuclear radiation of Wolf Creek as well as solar radiation from the atmosphere being lost due to anti-gravity in Canada. Anti-Gravity has been used to help break up the polar ice cap.

By melting polar ice caps: Canada is able to produce more food and find mineral value.
Too: it has aided in hunting displaced animals such as wild seals, moose, etc.
Such hunting: has lead the animals back into Montana, Wyoming, and even downtown Denver Colorado.

So we have fat fluffy domestic cats...
The size of smaller "Large American Cat" such as a lynx or whatever.




They are the truest meaning of pudum when tamed.
Most wonderful loving lap cats.
They are really good at avoiding disease... and shying from persons with bacterial infections.


Their stock came from an aspen forest which is naturally anti-bacterial.



Okay...
What do we do?
Can we breed them and sell them out to various persons?


They are usually found outside the Meat Locker at about 2-6 AM.
They can be called. 
Whistle the word "But-ter-brickle" as high pitched as you can.
Most will let you feed them, most will curl up to your feet and love on you....


Most will refuse to let you touch them.
Most will slap your hand if you try to pet them.




Those cats...
are all our family livestock that has sort of been abandoned by Paula.
It does look as though she is no longer living there from what I see on Satellite as well as Google Street. However... who knows?



They seem to be a solar as well as a nuclear mutant.



I would like to see a few generations and what they look like after living outside of a radioactive environment.

Too: I would like to see them be compared in size and weight to other cats from Loveland Colorado's feral cat population.










Who is living at 3. Anna?
What is the financial situation on the house?

If nobody and nothing....

Who has a ride to Kansas?
Pat seems to have cashed out my life insurance policy.
What is Virgil doing????
I have cats that need to be picked up.

If I cannot get a ride to Kansas...
I want to obnoxiously adopt each of those cats and I want to keep them sexually intact.
I would want them shipped to me here in Vancouver and call it my psychological therapy.
I have grown neurotic due to the high volume of canines which have moved into the region.


Here: we have a stable population of French Mongrel that look like our dog we picked up in Loveland (Happy)
Here: we have several people with such dogs.
Here: we have several kidnapped children of the BoyScout Massacres who brought their dogs.
Here: I do not exactly feel safe.
Mostly: because I do not have a gun to shoot either myself or others.



I suspect Paula to be dead.
She has socially interacted with Hockey Culture.
Hockey Culture....

Is also Jeffery Dahamer culture.
They are very anti-drug and anti-alcohol.


Too: due to the life insurance policy....
She might be in Canada replacing Freifrau Fenja, or she might be living with her....



Fenja....
was a Canadian city/country girl.
Von Ludwig....















These are moose found in Greeley Colorado.
