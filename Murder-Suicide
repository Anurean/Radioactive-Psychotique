Subject: Thoughts...
So...
Resource will be probably popping up.
Hopefully it will be popping up.
 
let's continue the whole SSDI BS, and put my case on the back seat to everyone else's...
if and when IBM as well as Emporia get their heads out of their butts: that will put money in my pocket and I can bounce.
We can discuss donations, exit strategy and such.
 
 
Oregon City...
has now been properly backmailed, extorted, and seduced.
So...
Packages might start popping up soon.
You know, clothes, art supplies, toiletries, medical supplies. 
 
 
 
Emporia...
Will be a no-go zone for about 10 years due to a bunch of pissed off twats all of whom have work as law enforcement officials.
I want a full roster of everyone hating on me.
We are at corporate war, and them hating on me, does mean I have to have them killed.
 
 
Portland...
There are a few people socially connected to me...
Who have committed suicide.
Which, is all good and groovy. 
Unless it's over the fact that I refuse to work with an IBM computer and really do dislike Windows/Microsoft.
 
IBM...
Is loving being bankrupted and their consumers are being digitally attacked.
Good times.
 
 
 
 
 
Moolahs hopefully will be hitting my paypal soon.
You know, so as I can atleast go have coffee.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Karl...
Buy me things.
Give me money.
I yo hooker is.
 
 
Oh and I want Amber's ashes in the divorce.
I want the ashes of her father in the divorce.
 
 
The word divorce... means murder frequently.
and I want my divorce to be a murder and I want to sit there with the ashes of my ex and her family and sit there and smile with her mommy Tina... who has been fairly abused by Amber and Carl Terp.
