These are advanced scripts in computer languages that I have not touched since I was a kid....
WOW.




I am a fallower of Jolly Rodger.
I might get you in trouble.
I was a private school drop out.
I see that you are not exactly yet out of what seems to be a highschool or prepatory school of some sort.
I would expect this of someone 4 years out of college.
Are you taking gifted classes in school or something?

So here is some LEGAL, legit fun you can do with your bank account.
My first checking account: I was 12.
However most people I know: dont get to hold a bank account until they are 16 or 18 or so.

Here is how to make a little money for college.
It is how I personally managed to invert the financial system of America and get some old friends out of Hong Kong who have been held up there too long.

Open an Ethereum Account.
If you do not have one: I do. 
Um, under the alias of Anurean somewhere.
Probably Apple.
That will give you a copy of my Ethereum Code, which I am almost in trouble for.
I sort of convinced every last sworn enemy to buy me 200 shares of gift stock that sell at 1,000$ each.
It's a peace offering when they do...


You can create a Q.R. Code designed to buy gift stock in various corporations.
Create a sticker of your Q.R. Code at "Sticker-Junkie"
Put your sticker near the license plate of the car.

What this will do: is cause A.I. systems designed to charge a credit account of the citizen to purchase stock.
Each A.I. system has the copacity to pull money from your accounts.
Each A.I. system has the copacity to investigate discarded trash, tracking information, Q.R. codes, etc.

If and when someone or something scans your QR code: it will bankrupt them.
I call that my Bankruptsy Square.



It's how we are the digital creeps of F.T.P. bankrupting the imperialist forces that would DARE violate American Territory with the word "police" or drop Polish Military forces on American soil or recruit Pollocks as law enforcement.

That information alone...
Will get you out of jail almost immediately of any petty crime.
It might make you wealthy some day too. 



Bleh...
Nevermind me.
I am old.
I might as well be a grandpa.
I am insane.
I am no longer 1337.


My first computer I learned to type on: was an IBM  XT.
